Automatically generates *correct* DNS SSHFP records, unlike ssh-keygen (even with patch).

Recommended usage model:

1. Put mksshfp on server.
2. Run ./mksshfp.sh etc
3. (Optional) If necessary, prepend each line with "host. 86400 IN SSHFP" or similar.
4. Copy results into DNS provider.

Alternatively, you can put mksshfp on your regular computer:

1. Put mksshfp on computer.
2. Run ./mksshfp.sh -
3. Paste /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key.pub when prompted.
4. Follow "Recommended usage model" starting from step 3.

Records tested with OpenSSH 5.9p1-hpn13v11.
